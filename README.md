# MixMHCpred
HLA-I ligand predictors MixMHCpred

This tool allows you to run binding predicitions for a list of peptides (9- aor 10-mers) to 58 of the most common HLA-I alleles.

It is trained on unbiased, high quality (< 1% FDR) and in-depth HLA peptidomics data.

If you use it, please currently cite our JI paper (Bassani-Sternberg and GFeller, JI, 2016) and our BioRxiv manuscript: Bassani-Sternberg et al., Deciphering HLA-I motifs across HLA peptidomes improves neo-antigen predictions and identifies allostery regulating HLA specificity (2017).
